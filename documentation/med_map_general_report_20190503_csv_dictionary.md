| R_MEDICATION_URI        | TURBO's unique identifier for an R_MEDICATION row from PDS.  (Some R_MEDICATIONs have non-unique names.  Also, the TURBO team believes there are occasionally cases where the PK for a R_MEDICATION is not consistent over time.)                                                                                                                              |

| SOURCE_CODE             | EHR from which the R_MEDICATION was imported                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| RXNORM_CODEs_pds        | RxNorm term assigned to the R_MEDICATION (by the 3M Healthcare information system?)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| RXNORM_CODEs_pds_active | Was the PDS-provided RxNorm code active (vs. retired) at the time of running the medication mapping?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| rxnvals_turbo           | ALL of the RxNorm terms found by the medication mapping, minus those that were classified  as only distantly related (FFFF).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| bestterm_turbo          | Semantic term, from any vocabulary, that best represents the R_MEDICATION.  Chosen mainly based on the most confident RF classification for the R_MEDICATION, solr results, minus the FFFF classified results.  Each score was boosted by 1.1 if it could be linked to an RxNorm term and also by 1.1 if the RF classified it as exactly right (TFFF or TTFF). |
| bestrxn_turbo           | RxNorm term equivalent to the best semantic term, if available.  Determined by identical UMLS CUIs, assertions from the Drug Ontology, and mappings from the NCBO Bioportal.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
