- [ ] Make images of visual graphs corresponding to user stories
- [ ] check defined in/is an ontology relationships
- [ ] confirm PDS R_MEDICATION PKs being used as stable PKs
- [ ] add the PKs as properties of the source medications? (As opposed to just being the RHS of the IRIs)
- [ ] make a sample, non-PDS input file
- [ ] try BioPortal ontology submission API method
- [ ] clean up file and variable names
- [ ] see if thereâ€™s anything worth keeping in the `extras` and `old` GitHub subdirectories
- [ ] purge other old files, semantic repos, Solr cores...
- [ ] plan for adding knowledge, e.g. from lung cancer effort
  - [ ] added knowledge destinations: 
    - [ ] custom BioPortal mappings (esp. for LOINC bld->blood in clinical labs)
    - [ ] Custom Solr documents
    - [ ] assertions (esp. dispositions) in DrOn
    - [ ] Assertions in TURBO ontology
- [ ] Check DrOn for inactive RxCUIs
- [ ] Check DrOn for ChEBI mappings exposed by BioPortal
- [ ] Add source medications to Solr
- [ ] Keep yaml template up to data
- [ ] remove minimal templating ontology from ROBOT
- [ ] use TURBO or OBO predicates for source/reference medications and classified search results, not `mydata:`
- [ ] direct relationship between source medication and rxcui
- [ ] add RxNorm types to RxCUIs
- [ ] more aggressive consensus building for the multiple acceptable classified search results that could be associated with a source medication.
  - [ ] maybe the direct relationships will make this moot
  - [ ] take a vote?
  - [ ] weight scores by classified semantic distance and sum?
  - [ ] lowest common subsumer?

- [ ] run again with lower min (EMPI) count... 20? 10?
  - [ ] still haven't taken any action about the apparent ceiling on the nuber of approximate match API calls from R script to RxNav in a box.
- [ ] would be nice to use R rdflib's as rdf function. see stack overflow issue.



## placeholder for clinical labs

- [ ] custom BioPortal mappings (esp. for LOINC bld->blood) ?
- [ ] ...
